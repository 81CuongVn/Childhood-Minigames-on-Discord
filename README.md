## ü§ñ Bot Information!

 - [Invite it, play with it, use it!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=927938123936198787&permissions=2180368448&scope=bot%20applications.commands) but make sure to grant **`SLASH COMMAND` & `EMBED` PERMISSIONS**. Official Discord Server: https://discord.gg/XGAHheQxde
 - This Bot got coded for the [Documatic](https://www.documatic.com/) Hackathon hosted on their [Discord](https://discord.gg/qQ6cpFFtNF).
 - It's coded with nodejs v16.13 but needs nodejs v16.6 or higher, due to latest discord.js version. Technically it doesn't need any other packages, except the ones which are build in nodejs such as `fs`, `readline`, etc. but if you want you could add a custom DB, there is an example for it...
 - All Emojis used are provided in a Folder, which can be used, but not needed, because u can use [UNICODE](https://getemoji.com) Emojis too!
 - The Theme of this BOT is **"CHILD GAMES"**, this means it is inspiried by Games we used to play as a child!
 - It supports multiple languages and you can easily add more!
 - It has a OWN CODED DATABASE with JSON, aka it can corrupt on BIG DATAS soon, so you might adjust database.js (it's easy to change!!!! as you have functions for it!) I might add examples for something like enmap)
 - and more!

***

## ‚ùì How does this Bot work ?

 - It works fully via Slash Commands. means it needs to be invited with the `applications.commands` Scope.
 - Other wise, each game needs to ping a player with which you want to play with (in some you can play alone).
 - You can only play 1 Game at once.
 - You can only request 1 Player-Enemy at once.
 - Make sure to respond quick, otherwise the games might end.

***

## üëæ All Games

Currently there is only 1 Game:

### üí≥ Memory Game

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oAqi4N1.png" style="width: 50%">

 - The Memory Game is simple explained, it is like **MEMORY CARDS**.
 - You pic 2 Cards and remember them. If it's a **match** you get **1 Point**.
 - The one with the **most points** is the **winner**.
 - you can play with the **bot, he is an EASY AI**, aka it will calculate the % of when to win and always win after X different wrong pics
 - You can play with **yourself** (but you will get 1 win and 1 loose at the same time... aka you control player 1 and 2)
 - You have **1 Minute** to **pic 2 cards**. Otherwise the game will end!
 - [Here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/memory/game-rules.php) are **offical Memory Rules**
